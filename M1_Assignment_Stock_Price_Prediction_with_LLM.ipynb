        "\n",
        "This assignment explores how large language models (LLMs) can perform complex tasks that previously required coding. Instead of manually writing code, we will interact with Google's Gemini (Click on the Gemini icon on the top right corner) in Google Colab to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Load and analyze stock price data.\n",
        "- Engineer relevant features for prediction.\n",
        "- Build and evaluate models such as regression and random forest.\n",
        "- Discuss potential trading strategies based on predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: While this notebook contains example code, students are encouraged to use LLMs to generate code snippets and explanations, managing interactions within the LLM's context window.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task Breakdown\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Data Exploration\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Load historical stock price data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from 2020-01-01 to 2023-01-01 using Yahoo Finance.\n",
        "- **Key Considerations**: Ensure the model retains context while summarizing key statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Feature Engineering\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Generate meaningful features such as moving averages, technical indicators, and volatility measures.\n",
        "- **Managing Context**: If the LLM forgets prior outputs, remind it by reintroducing key statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Model Building\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Train a model (regression for price prediction, random forest for trend classification).\n",
        "- **Split Ratio Consideration**: Explain the importance of train-test split (e.g., 70/30) and verify the LLM respects it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Model Evaluation & Prediction\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Use the trained model to predict stock prices for 2023-2024.\n",
        "- **Analyze Performance**: Interpret accuracy, RÂ² scores, and classification reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 5: Strategy Discussion\n",
        "- **Prompt the LLM**: Based on model performance, discuss possible trading strategies.\n",
        "- **Critical Thinking**: Evaluate whether the model is truly useful for financial decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the assignment, keep in mind that LLMs have a limited context window. If necessary, break down tasks into smaller chunks and reintroduce critical information.\n",

        "- **Context Management**: LLMs have limited memory, so breaking tasks into smaller steps and reinforcing context is crucial.\n",
        "- **Feature Engineering with LLMs**: The model can suggest features but needs guidance on financial relevance.\n",
        "- **Modeling with LLMs**: LLMs can write and refine code, but human judgment is necessary to validate results.\n",
        "- **Real-world Limitations**: Stock price prediction remains challenging; models should be used critically and not solely relied upon for trading decisions.\n",

        "Next Steps:\n",
        "- Experiment with different LLMs and compare outputs.\n",
        "- Try refining feature engineering techniques.\n",
